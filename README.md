Arduino Controlled RC
Our IoT project is a webpage controlled vehicle modelled around the utilisation of an Arduino YÃºn as our embedded system. The Arduino mounted to a small base is intended to act both as a web server hosting our control webpage while also sending directional inputs to two motors attached to caterpillar tracks front &  back.
Our Arduino program is intended to both post the contents of our webpage while also reading the inputs of the 'forward', 'back', 'left' & 'right' buttons displayed in  a controller format on the page. Once an input is read, the buttons specific function will be executed, sending power to the designated GPIO pin of each motor.
